# School Club Activity Showcase

Project done by Team 9:
Francesco Bolner, Georgi Bozhkov, Samuele Fumagalli, Ayoub Merdan, Martin Ushilov

Team 9's Software Engineering project is to create a website regarding School Club Activities. Everyone who visits
the website will be able to see recent news on events organised by all clubs, however, the website is designed 
specifically for school pupils and school ID will be required to log in or sign up. Depending on their status, the 
signed user could either be a Student, Member, Vice-President or Leader. 

Students may use the website to search for specific clubs, enrol in them (and become a member), and provide public 
comments about their experiences with them. Members are students, that are enrolled in one or more clubs, where 
they take part in events, created by the clubs. If desired, students could also form clubs to share their favourite 
activity or experience with others. If the club in question becomes popular, the leader/creator of the club could 
either hire vice-presidents of his choice  to assist him with management and event creation, or he could choose the 
number of places the club will have when it is created.
